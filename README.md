# CITES-Trade-Analysis
# This project brings together two major global datasets, UN ComTrade and the CITES Trade Database. 
# All data points are from the year 2016. 
# CITES does not have an API, so the relevant data is stored in this repository. 
# The first commit of this script cleans, summarizes, merges, and shapes the data such that it can be plotted.
