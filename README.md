# CITES-Trade-Analysis
This project aims to reveal some of the major trends in the global endangered species trade. 
All data are from the year 2016. 
CITES does not have an API, so the relevant data is stored in this repository. Comtrade data is taken from their API. 
This script produces several plots and a network visualization stored in the working directory as an html file.
